Welcome to the new home of the Casual Coders blog! 

## Who are you?

We are the Casual Coders! We are a group of friends, consisting of engineers and makers who talk nerd and make cool stuff!

## What's this blog for?

This blog is for notes about our projects, posting of data we collected from experiments, and just any random posts we were compelled to write!
